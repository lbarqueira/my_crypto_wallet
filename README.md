# my_crypto_wallet

A Flutter WEB project developed during #30daysOfFlutter.

Deployed at Netlify
https://unruffled-turing-5b1822.netlify.app

## Concepts

CryptoCurrency Wallet Web app to learn how to utilize Firebase Authentication, Firebase Cloud Firestore, and API requests (HTTP package) to https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/.
The app also does user input validation.

Work yet to be done in the near future...
- Separation of concerns by using State Management
- Improve UI
- Responsive / Adaptive design
- PWA (was not created by default ???)

This work was carried out within the scope of #30daysOfFlutter and inspired by [Bleyl Dev](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIV0tE4cC3Ufk44-KVZqv7w) work.

Any issue, and improvement recommendations are welcome.

Thanks!
